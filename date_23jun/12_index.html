    <h1>Welcome to My Learning Journey</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm a passionate web developer who loves building things with code.
      This page showcases my progress and interests in the world of technology.
    </p>

    <h3>Technologies I Use</h3>
    <p>
      I have experience working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like
      React. I'm also exploring backend technologies to become a full-stack
      developer. I follow tutorials and articles from resources like
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a>
      to improve my skills.
    </p>

    <h4>Future Goals</h4>
    <p>
      My goal is to contribute to open-source projects and build impactful
      products. I also plan to learn TypeScript and advanced React concepts to
      strengthen my frontend skills.
